# Matry JS

MatryJS is a library that consists of various utilities needed for parsing and rendering the output of the Matry language.

Matry is organized into modules. There are three core modules of the language:
  - tokens
  - components
  - mocks

There are also several sub-modules:
  - elements
  - contexts
  - styles
  - draws

As well as additional concepts that support the behavior for each of these modules:
  - types
  - groups
  - expressions
  - attributes

This library is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use.
Eventually it will contain all the required functionality for the above components.
The goal of this package is to give developers a useful toolkit with which they can build their own implementation for Matry.

Details about the Matry language are outside the scope of this library.
